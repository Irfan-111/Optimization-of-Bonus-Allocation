# Optimization of Bonus Allocation in Betting Apps

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing the allocation of bonuses in a betting app to enhance customer engagement and increase overall revenue. By analyzing customer behavior and betting patterns, the project aims to identify which customers should receive bonuses and predict the effectiveness of those bonuses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes various features related to customer betting behavior, including:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer
- **Country**: Country of the customer
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer
- **Age**: Age of the customer
- **Income Level (k)**: Income level of the customer in thousands
- **Total Number of Bets**: Total bets placed by the customer
- **Total Amount Wagered**: Total amount wagered by the customer
- **Average Bet Amount**: Average bet amount of the customer
- **Winning Percentage**: Percentage of bets won by the customer
- **Active Days**: Number of days the customer was active
- **Days Since Last Bet**: Days since the customer's last bet
- **Preferred Bet Type**: Type of bet the customer prefers
- **Has Received Bonus Before**: Indicates if the customer has received a bonus before
- **Number of Bonuses Received**: Number of bonuses received by the customer
- **Amount of Bonuses Received**: Total amount of bonuses received
- **Revenue from Bonuses**: Revenue generated from bonuses
- **Increase in Bets After Bonus**: Increase in bets after receiving a bonus
- **Increase in Wagering After Bonus**: Increase in wagering after receiving a bonus
- **Should Receive Bonus**: Target variable indicating if the customer should receive a bonus

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Cleaning and handling missing values.
   - Feature engineering to create new features from existing data.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and relationships.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Tried multiple models including SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest.
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Feature selection based on importance and correlation analysis.

3. **SVM Model**:
   - Implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 95%.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the final model using Streamlit for easy access and user interaction.

## Results

- **Model Performance**: 
   - The SVM model achieved an accuracy of **95%**, significantly improving the prediction of which customers should receive bonuses.
